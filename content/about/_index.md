I am a research scientist aiming to help conserve nature and promote effective management of pest species. My work tends to focus on species introduced beyond their natural range: estimating their distribution, density and ecosystem impacts. Invasive species management can have unintended consequences which need to be weighed up against potential benefits on a case-by-case basis. For example, in my PhD I investigated a potential behavioural and numerical 'release' of feral cats following poison-baiting programs targeting introduced red foxes, which may explain why some native prey species do not benefit from fox control. I am particularly interested in how top predators shape ecosystems, as well as the ability of our monitoring and modelling practices to uncover these processes.

These days I am spending less time in the field and more time finessing over statistical models. I completed my PhD with the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology group](https://qaeco.com) at the University of Melbourne. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au) Adaptive Biosecurity Management team, based in Brisbane. Here I mostly stitch together different data types to (i) forecast house mouse plagues in grain growing regions, and (ii) predict current distributions of invasive species across Australia, such as feral pigs.
