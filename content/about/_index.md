I want to help conserve nature and promote more effective management of 'problem' species. My research tends to focus on species introduced beyond their natural range: where and how many there are, their interactions with other species and impact on ecosystem function. This is ~~probably some weak, subconscious attempt to appease white guilt by righting the wrongs of my colonial ancestors~~ a key area in which western science can be useful in reversing the extinction crisis and enabling sustainable management practices. Invasive species removal can have unintended consequences which need to be weighed up against potential benefits on a case-by-case basis. For example, my PhD investigated a potential behavioural and numerical 'release' of feral cats following poison-baiting programs targeting introduced red foxes, which may explain why some native prey species do not benefit from fox control. I am particularly interested in how top predators shape ecosystems, as well as the ability of our monitoring and modelling practices to uncover these processes.

These days I am spending less time in the field and more time finessing over statistical models which make sense of our piecemeal ecological data. Not sure if I have become more interested in maths or just burnt out from leech bites and risk assessments... I recently completed my PhD and several small contracts with the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology group](https://qaeco.com) at the University of Melbourne. Now I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au) Adaptive Biosecurity Management team, based in Brisbane. Here I mostly stitch together different data types to (i) forecast house mouse plagues in grain growing regions, and (ii) predict current distributions of invasive species across Australia (such as gamba grass and feral pigs).

Please drop me a line if you would like a free copy of a publication or have questions about my research.
