I am a quantitative and applied ecologist, researching the best approaches for nature conservation and pest management. 
I work closely with conservation, biosecurity and agricultural stakeholders to address real-world problems and improve actions on the ground.
Typically, I make sense of messy datasets to model species population dynamics, evaluate management actions and improve monitoring designs. 
Rather than a single study species or system, I am passionate about robust and reproducible science; equally content surveying wild animals as coding complex statistical models. 
Based in Canberra, Australia, a current focus of my work is developing near-term forecasts for outbreak risk of house mouse populations --- a major socioeconomic and environmental threat to rural Australia. 
I serve on the Executive Committee of the [Queensland Conservation Council](https://www.queenslandconservation.org.au/) during my spare time, which provides a united voice for environmental community groups across the state.
