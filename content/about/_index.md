I am a postdoctoral research fellow with the [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au) Adaptive Biosecurity Management team based in Brisbane, Australia. I use quantitative methods to improve conservation monitoring and management, with a focus on invasive species ecology. My CERC postdoctoral fellowship covers a range of invasive animal projects, but most of my time is spent trying to forecast mouse plagues in agricultural regions. I recently finished my PhD (under examination) and a short postdoctoral position with the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology group](https://qaeco.com) at the University of Melbourne. Here my research focused on the interactions between introduced foxes, feral cats and threatened native prey.
